# Typescript-tutorial
This repo is all About understanding how type script works 

*Type script is a programming language that is a superset of javascript.*

*which is it basically extends javascript but it adds and brings much futures*

The basic different between type script and javascript is the use of "strict" wheich is to say when you decerlar one variable to be a particular type it cannier bechanged 

# Defining Type in typeScript

Types in typeScript HELPS when declaring values to variables either in a function or when ever you want to pass a parameter

# objects and Array in TypeScript 

In typeScript Array and Object works the same way as in typeScript but then the only difference is that when trying to reasign a variable IN OBJECT YOU WONT BE ABLE TO REPLACE A STRING WITH A ANUMBER OR VISE VERSER


# Explicit types 
this is a process of strictly decaring types of variables , objects and array 
dd
# Dynamic types(any)
type any is used for type of variable when declaring any it means any type is accepted. it kinda gon back to javascript 

# Functions Types 

Functions types wroks the same as normal javascript just more of diceration of types 

# Type Aliases
Type Aliases this is a process where by you the type of all particular function or objects are been stored in a variable and the top and also this variable can also be reused to aviod duplication of codes  

# Function Signatures  

it basicity describes the General structure of a function 
this is used to determine the argument a function takes in and also what type of data it returns 

# Dom and Type Casting 

This is a process of manipulating and getting datas from dom.. like its doone in javascript.

# classes in Type script 
class in typescript is same thing with class in javascript 

# Public Privacy and security 

 This is the process of securing your imofrmation on your data base. this is done by adding public , private and readuy only. they are called access modifiyers 

# Typescript Interface
