# Typescript-tutorial
This repo is all About understanding how type script works 

*Type script is a programming language that is a superset of javascript.*

*which is it basically extends javascript but it adds and brings much futures*

The basic different between type script and javascript is the use of "strict" wheich is to say when you decerlar one variable to be a particular type it cannier bechanged 

# Defining Type in typeScript

Types in typeScript HELPS when declaring values to variables either in a function or when ever you want to pass a parameter

# objects and Array in TypeScript 

In typeScript Array and Object works the same way as in typeScript but then the only difference is that when trying to reasign a variable IN OBJECT YOU WONT BE ABLE TO REPLACE A STRING WITH A ANUMBER OR VISE VERSER


# Explicit types 
this is a process of strictly decaring types of variables , objects and array 
dd
# Dynamic types(any)
type any is used for type of variable when declaring any it means any type is accepted. it kinda gon back to javascript
